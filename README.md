## Features

- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Step-by-step wizard workflow** for creating comprehensive test suites
- üìö **Comprehensive prompts** covering analysis, planning, setup, and implementation
- üéØ **Best practices** for selectors, fixtures, and parallel execution
- üîß **Optional enhancements** for accessibility and API testing
- üìñ **Reference documentation** for advanced patterns
- üåê **MCP Registry integration** for easy discovery and installation

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- An **MCP-compatible client**:
  - [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in VS Code (with MCP support)
  - [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
  - [Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) (VS Code extension)
  - Any other MCP-compatible AI client

## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

No installation required! Use `npx` to run the server on-demand:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright-wizard": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "playwright-wizard-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

This approach automatically uses the latest version without managing local installations.

### Global Installation

For faster startup and offline use:

```bash
npm install -g playwright-wizard-mcp
```

Then configure without `npx`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright-wizard": {
      "command": "playwright-wizard-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

Playwright Wizard exposes 15 tools organized into three categories: core workflow, optional enhancements, and reference documentation.

### Core Workflow (Complete in Order)

These 5 tools guide you through creating a complete, production-ready test suite:

| Tool | Purpose | What It Creates | When to Use |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **analyze-app** | Analyzes your application structure and tech stack | `project-config.md`, `pages.md`, `selector-strategy.md` | **Start here** - First step for any new test suite |
| **generate-test-plan** | Creates comprehensive test scenarios and acceptance criteria | `test-plan.md` with suites, flows, and edge cases | After analyzing the app |
| **setup-infrastructure** | Sets up Playwright config, fixtures, and folder structure | `playwright.config.ts`, fixtures, test helpers | After test plan is ready |
| **generate-page-objects** | Generates type-safe page object models with optimal selectors | Page object files in `tests/pages/` | After infrastructure is set up |
| **implement-test-suite** | Writes actual tests with assertions and error handling | Complete test files in `tests/` | Final step - implement all planned tests |

### Optional Enhancements

Add these capabilities after completing the core workflow:

| Tool | Purpose | What It Adds | When to Use |
|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **setup-ci-cd** | Adds GitHub Actions for automated testing | `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` | When you need CI/CD integration |
| **add-accessibility** | Integrates axe-core for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | Accessibility test helpers and examples | For accessibility requirements |
| **add-api-testing** | Adds REST/GraphQL/tRPC API testing | API test utilities and examples | When testing backend APIs |
| **advanced-optimization** | Deep performance optimization and auth state reuse | Advanced patterns and configs | For complex apps with performance needs |

### Reference Documentation

Access these anytime for additional context and patterns:

| Tool | Content | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| **reference-core-principles** | Core testing principles and quality standards | You need guidance on best practices |
| **reference-workflow-overview** | Complete workflow explanation and prompt relationships | You want to understand the big picture |
| **reference-mcp-setup** | MCP server setup and usage patterns | Having installation or configuration issues |

| **reference-data-storage-patterns** | Test data storage patterns (ORM, JSON, MSW) | Need guidance on test data management |

### How to Use the Tools

Simply ask your AI assistant to use them:

```
"Use the analyze-app tool to help me understand my application"
"Run the generate-test-plan tool to create test scenarios"
"Use setup-infrastructure to configure Playwright"
```

The AI will call the appropriate tool, receive detailed instructions, and execute them automatically. You'll see the results (files created, analysis completed) without seeing the internal instructions.

## Getting Started

### First-Time Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Install and configure** the MCP server (see [Configuration](#configuration) above)
2. **Restart your AI client** (Claude Desktop or VS Code)
3. **Verify installation**: Open a new chat and look for the üî® tool icon

### Creating Your First Test Suite (30-60 minutes)

Here's what a typical workflow looks like:

**Step 1: Analyze Your Application**

```text
You: "Help me analyze my React app for Playwright testing"

AI: *Calls analyze-app tool*
    - Detects React, TypeScript, Vite from package.json
    - Browses key pages (/, /login, /dashboard)
    - Evaluates DOM quality and accessibility
    - Creates .playwright-wizard-mcp/ folder with analysis files

AI: "‚úÖ Analysis complete! Your app uses React + TypeScript with Vite.
     I found 5 key pages. HTML quality is good (score: 8/10).
     Created project-config.md, pages.md, and selector-strategy.md."
```

**Step 2: Generate Test Plan**

```text
You: "Create a test plan based on the analysis"

AI: *Calls generate-test-plan tool*
    - Creates comprehensive test scenarios
    - Defines user flows and edge cases
    - Specifies acceptance criteria
    - Adds test data requirements

AI: "‚úÖ Test plan created! I've defined 4 test suites:
     - Authentication (5 scenarios)
     - Dashboard (7 scenarios)
     - User Profile (4 scenarios)
     - Settings (3 scenarios)
     See test-plan.md for details."
```

**Step 3: Set Up Infrastructure**

```text
You: "Set up the Playwright infrastructure"

AI: *Calls setup-infrastructure tool*
    - Creates playwright.config.ts with optimal settings
    - Sets up fixtures for parallel execution
    - Creates folder structure (tests/, pages/, fixtures/)
    - Adds test helpers and utilities

AI: "‚úÖ Infrastructure ready!
     - Created playwright.config.ts (3 browsers, parallel mode)
     - Set up custom fixtures for test isolation
     - Organized folder structure
     Ready for page objects!"
```

**Step 4: Generate Page Objects**

```text
You: "Generate page object models"

AI: *Calls generate-page-objects tool*
    - Creates type-safe page objects
    - Uses optimal selectors (getByRole, getByLabel)
    - Adds TypeScript types
    - Implements reusable methods

AI: "‚úÖ Page objects created!
     - tests/pages/LoginPage.ts
     - tests/pages/DashboardPage.ts
     - tests/pages/ProfilePage.ts
     All use accessible selectors and TypeScript."
```

**Step 5: Implement Tests**

```text
You: "Implement the test suite"

AI: *Calls implement-test-suite tool*
    - Writes complete test files
    - Adds proper assertions and error handling
    - Verifies parallel execution
    - Optimizes performance

AI: "‚úÖ Test suite complete!
     - Created 19 tests across 4 suites
     - All tests pass ‚úì
     - Average execution: 12s (parallel)
     - 100% of tests use page objects
     Run: npx playwright test"
```

### What Gets Created

The wizard creates a complete test infrastructure in your project:

```
your-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .playwright-wizard-mcp/     # Workflow documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-config.md       # Tech stack analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages.md                # Page inventory
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selector-strategy.md    # Selector approach
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-plan.md            # Test scenarios
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/                  # Page object models
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LoginPage.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DashboardPage.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ProfilePage.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures/               # Custom fixtures
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ authFixture.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers/                # Test utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testHelpers.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.spec.ts           # Test files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.spec.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ profile.spec.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playwright.config.ts        # Playwright configuration
```

### Next Steps

After completing the core workflow, consider:

- **Add CI/CD**: `"Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing"`
- **Add accessibility testing**: `"Add axe-core accessibility testing"`
- **Add API testing**: `"Help me test my REST API alongside UI tests"`
- **Optimize performance**: `"Show me advanced optimization patterns"`

## How It Works

When you ask Copilot to help with Playwright testing:

1. **You**: "Help me analyze my app for testing"
2. **Copilot**: Calls the `analyze-app` tool
3. **Tool**: Returns detailed instructions to Copilot
4. **Copilot**: Executes the instructions (detects stack, browses pages, creates files)
5. **You see**: "‚úÖ Analysis complete! Created project-config.md, pages.md..."

**You see results, not prompts.** The tools provide Copilot with expert-level instructions that it follows automatically.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# In your app project, ask Copilot:
"Help me set up Playwright testing for this app"

# Copilot will:
# 1. Call analyze-app ‚Üí detect stack, browse pages
# 2. Call generate-test-plan ‚Üí create test scenarios
# 3. Call setup-infrastructure ‚Üí create config and fixtures
# 4. Call generate-page-objects ‚Üí create page models
# 5. Call implement-test-suite ‚Üí write actual tests
```

All workflow documentation files are created in `.playwright-wizard-mcp/` folder in your project root:

- `project-config.md` - Detected tech stack
- `pages.md` - Page analysis with DOM quality scores
- `selector-strategy.md` - Selector approach per page
- `test-plan.md` - Test suites with progress tracking

> **Note:** The `.playwright-wizard-mcp/` folder is for workflow tracking only. You may want to add it to `.gitignore`.
