## Context7 Integration

All reference files encourage using Context7 MCP to get the absolute latest docs:

```typescript
await mcp_context7_get_library_docs({ 
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/microsoft/playwright",
  topic: "[relevant topic]"
});
```

References provide patterns, Context7 provides latest API details.
